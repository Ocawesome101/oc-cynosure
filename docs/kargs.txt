// CYNOSURE KERNEL ARGUMENTS

The following kernel arguments are supported by the Cynosure kernel.

  init=/PATH/TO/FILE
    Specifies the script to load as init.  Defaults to /sbin/init.lua.

  loglevel=LEVEL
    Only print logs whose level is higher than LEVEL.  Defaults to 1.

  nottylinebuffer
    Disables the TTY line buffer.  Not recommended.

  no_force_yields
    Disables the kernel's pre-emptive multitasking feature.  May be useful for performance reasons, or for testing if the load() wrapper breaks your code.

  debug_load
    Write all of the load() wrapper's processed code to /load.txt.  Intended for debugging if you think the load() wrapper breaks your code.

  max_process_time=NUMBER
    The maximum time, in seconds, for which a process may run before it is forcibly yielded.  Defaults to 0.1.

  log_process_death
    Write process death information to the kernel log.  Intended for debugging.

  root=TYPE=ADDRESS
    If TYPE is "UUID", then the kernel will try to detect a filesystem on the specified drive or filesystem component.  Otherwise, if TYPE is "LABEL", the kernel will try to find a filesystem or partition whose label matches the specified one.  TYPE will default to "UUID" if it is not recognized.

    If this option is not specified, computer.getBootAddress() will be used to determine the root filesystem.  Note that this functionality is deprecated and may be removed in a future version.

  no_wrap_coroutine
    Do not wrap the version of the coroutine API presented to userspace.  There should be little reason to use this option, since Cynosure's wrapper only adds features.  Only use for testing if you think this wrapper breaks something related to coroutines.

  tty.profile=NUMBER
    Set the TTY color profile to that matching NUMBER.  If a matching profile is not found, defaults to the first one (the old color scheme).

  tty.colors=N:HEXCOL,N:HEXCOL,...
    Change one or more specific TTY colors.  N is the index starting from 0, and HEXCOL is a 24-bit hexadecimal color **without** a prefix (for example, a:f2abac is valid, but 0:0x2dfe is not).
