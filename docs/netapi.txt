// CYNOSURE NETWORKING INTERFACE

Cynosure provides a fairly simple method for abstraction of network protocols.

Network modules should be included into extra/net/base.lua (--#include "extra/net/example.lua"), and should add an entry to the 'protocols' table structured like the following:

    protocols[protocol] = {
      socket = function(self, url, ...): stream,
      request = function(self, url, ...): stream
    }

    This entry should be added as a key corresponding to the protocol;  to go along with the #include above, protocols["example"].  All URLs beginning with "example://" will henceforth be redirected to the "example" protocol.

  'self' in both cases will be a string denoting the protocol used, useful for supporting multiple protocols with the same handler functions.

  See extra/net/internet.lua for an example network handler.
